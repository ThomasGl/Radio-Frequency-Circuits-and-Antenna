\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1}(5 points) Build a CST model of a 50[$\Omega $] coaxial line with an inner pin diameter of 1mm, and with a dielectric medium (in between the inner pin and the external shield) of a material named Teflon. The length of the coax cable should be two wavelengths (according to the frequency given in the table below). Place ports at the input and at the output of the coax line, with characteristic impedance (of the ports) according to that of the coax cable (as specified in the table) and simulate the 2ports S-Parameters over the frequency band of 0.7f -1.3f.}{3}{section.1}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2}(15 points) Build a CST model of the patch antenna, according to the above guidelines and your patch antenna parameters in the table below. Use the designed coax cable in a length of a quarter wavelength in order to feed the patch antenna, without using a microstrip line: create a hole in the ground plane in a diameter which is identical to that of the shield of the coax cable, insert the edge of the coax cable into this hole, and extend the inner core of the coax above the ground plane so that it will touch the metal plate that implements the patch. Now, fine-tune the (allowed) parameters of the antenna in order to achieve a matching (Return Loss, or S11 in dB scale) of better than -10dB over the frequency band 0.98f -1.02f. Note that the impedance of the coax cable must remain 50[$\Omega $]!}{4}{section.2}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {3}(5 points) Build a CST model of a 100$[\Omega ]$ microstrip line that it is implemented on the same dielectric substrate as your optimized patch antenna. The length of the microstrip should be two wavelengths (according to the frequency given in the table below). Place wave ports at the input and at the output of the microstrip line and simulate the 2 ports S-Parameters over the frequency band of 0.7f -1.3f.}{13}{section.3}%
\contentsline {section}{\numberline {4}(15 points) In this section you are required to replace the coax feed with a microstrip feed for the patch antenna: feed the patch antenna that you designed in Section 2 using the microstrip line that you designed in Section 3. In this case, the microstrip line should have a length of a half wavelength. Place a lumped port on the far edge of the microstrip line in order to feed it. The impedance of the line must remain 100$[\Omega ]$ and all the patch parameters (width, length, height of the substrate) must remain the same as in Section 2 above! If needed, a quarter wavelength transmission line can be designed in order to match the patch antenna to the 100$[\Omega ]$ microstrip line. Other matching options of the patch antenna to the line can be used instead. Now, fine-tune the (allowed) parameters in order to achieve a matching (Return Loss, or $S_{11}$ in dB scale) of better than 10dB over the frequency band 0.98f - 1.02f.}{15}{section.4}%
